## PROMPT_1
As a Python, WordPress, and XML expert, write a script that replace the html tag "&quot;" by the real sign:

```xml
replace &quot; by "
replace &lt; by <
replace &gt; by >
```


## output_1


Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple Python script that uses the `html` module to replace HTML entities with their corresponding characters:

```python
import html

def replace_html_entities(text):
    return html.unescape(text)

# Test the function
text = 'This is a test &quot;string&quot; with &lt;html&gt; entities.'
print(replace_html_entities(text))
```

This script defines a function `replace_html_entities` that takes a string as input and returns a new string with all HTML entities replaced by their corresponding characters. The `html.unescape` function is used to perform this replacement.

The script then tests this function with a sample string that contains HTML entities. The result is printed to the console.
